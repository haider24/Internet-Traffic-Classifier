This project is about an internet traffic classification tool which classifies the internet traffic belonging to different application layer protocols. The internet traffic is collected through some sort of packet analyzer and capturing tool. This tool obtains packets from live packet captures obtained through tcpdump and identifies as well as quantizes different types of traffic such as Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Real Time Transfer Protocol (RTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) etc.
